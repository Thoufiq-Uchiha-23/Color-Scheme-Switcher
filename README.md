+ Here I used my knowledge of HTML and CSS to Create the interface.
+ My main Motive was to Learn JS, from which I came across the crucial concept of DOM.
+ It operates by targeting the HTML Elements where we can change the current state of elements, by accessing the class, id, and tag attributes of the HTML Document.
+ While applying CSS to make it fun, I also applied the hover effect which makes it look simple yet more decorative.
+ Here you'll find four colors: Grey, White, Blue, and Yellow theme-based colors.
